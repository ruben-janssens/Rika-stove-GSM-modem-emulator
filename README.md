# Rika-stove-GSM-modem-emulator

Allows you to simulate the GSM modem of a Rika Revo pellet stove. Connected via Ethernet, it becomes possible to control the stove with a home automation system.

NOTE: The .ino file has been perfectly functional for 2 years with me. It corresponds to the firmware of my stove, there is no guarantee of operation with more recent Rika stoves, nor with an identical stove but with a different firmware. (This was written by the owner)

Requirements :
- an ARDUINO board based on ATMega128
- an Ethernet shield
- an RS232 socket (see wiring diagram)
- 3 LED
- A power supply
